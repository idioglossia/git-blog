# Git Blog

Git Blog generate a simple blog website hosted by `github pages` and lets you manage users of your blog. Each user can create blog posts.

This tool uses [Sloth DB](https://github.com/idioglossia/sloth-db) json wrapper called [Json Sloth](https://github.com/idioglossia/json-sloth) as a storage where users, posts, tags and files are stored.
This data will be easily accessible through javascript and web browser. Therefore your data is pretty much dynamic but for sure slower than normal blogs.

Git Blog is not built to support large scale blog with lots of users and posts, so You should go easy on it!
But it does support simple post managements and content organization.

An example of generated blog is available [here](https://idioglossia.github.io/git-blog-test/). Don't forget that the data there is just for example purpose and can be edited.
